# Introduction

AshLog is an open source logging API which lets you store logs in the cloud and aggregate them into "projects".

A project can, but not necessarily, be related to a single application, like a web or desktop app. The aim of the aggregation is to separate the different kind of logs and make some of those avaliable for other user in order to collaborate on it.
